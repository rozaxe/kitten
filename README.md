# Kitten

Kitten is a web app to help you save money for the things you love.

Basically, it allows you to split your treasury (the money available in your bank's account) into kitties (e.g. Trip to Paris, PS5, Housing, etc.) you wish to save money for.

Of course, no banking information is ever needed, everything is done through the user's manual ~~labor~~ input.

## How to

After registering, set your current treasury.

Click the edition icon right to "Treasury". You will be prompted to enter your amount.

Next, create some kitties.

For instance you might be planning a trip to Marseille in France? Or you might be trying to save money for buying a house? Or you just want to keep some cash for Cyberpunk 2077 and its incoming DLC??

This is what a kitty is for. Click on "New kitty" and fill in the blanks.

After that, you can start saving money!

Click on a kitty. You should see a detailed page of your kitty.

On top, you can edit or archive it.

Below, this is where you make savings. Just click the button to add some money (or withdraw some). As you do so, you should see your treasury lowering and your kitty increasing. That's great, you have virtually saved money (make sure to not spend it in real-life though 😉)!

Now for the **best** part. When your kitty overflows with money, it is time to spend it 🤩

Click on "New expense", fill in the blanks, and *bam*! You made an expense with your hard-earned money.

When your kitty is not useful anymore, you can archive it. Any money left will return to your treasury.

And that's it!

I hope you'll enjoy spending wisely with Kitten 🐾
